The two python files **utils_data_viewer.py** and **utils_obj_det.py** contain plenty of methods that visualize different aspects of the dataset, like lidar projected in an image, top down view on all 5 radars, interactive 3D visualization oflidar data and more.

The **DetectionLearning.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook contains the method that performs 3D clustering on the LiDAR data and subsequential Kalman Filtering. The Kalman Filter is implemented in **Detection.py**. Please view **DetectionLearning.ipynb** for a more detailed algorithm description.

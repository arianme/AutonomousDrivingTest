The two python files contain plenty of methods that visualize different aspects of the dataset, like lidar projected in an image, top down view on all 5 radars, etc.

The **DetectionLearning.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook contains the method which performs 3D clustering on the LiDAR data and subsequential Kalman Filtering. The Kalman Filter is implemented in **Detection.py**. Please view **DetectionLearning.ipynb** for a more detailed description of the algorithm.
